# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: April 16, 2017 - Caesar Cipher
Worked on PicoCTF challenges, came across a challenge to decrypt a block of text. I thought it might have been encrypted with the caesar cipher. I worked through the inventwithpython chapter on doing the caesar cipher and learned how to grab the ascii values of characters and then shift them appropriately. In the end it turns out the block of text wasn't caesar encrypted, but I 
learned about ascii values so that's cool. 

### Day 1: April 25, 2017 - matplotlib
#python
#Note, had to start over since I missed many days
Worked on an assignment for the coursera matplotlib class. Figured out how to pull row avg's into a variable, and stored several years of avgs in a list. Plotted that list using matplotlib. Wrote some if conditions to colour the bars in the chart if their value was above a certain threshold or not.

### Day 2: April 26, 2017 - crypt(), uid, gid

### Day 10: May 4, 2017 - Debuging 
#Python
Found an error in a script I use at work that was checking on a partial match instead of an exact match, leading to bloated results. Debugged and fixed the error. 

### Day 11: May 5, 2017 - TCP/UDP connections

### Day 14: May 8, 2017 - Continuing with non-blocking I/O and async tasks 
#Python
Reworked the chat program to use event-driven architecture. 

### Day 15: May 9, 2017 - Classes
#Python
Refreshed myself on classes. Implemented a couple simple examples in python. 

### Day 16: May 10, 2017 - Relative and fixed paths

Worked on contuining with a work related automation project. Attempting to use shutil to move files around and organize them. Running into trouble working with paths, but making progress.

### Day 17: May 11, 2017 - assertions, logging, etc!
#Python
Spent time re-learning about assetions and practiign with the logging module. Also covered some ground on exceptions 

### Day 18: May 12, 2017 - resizing images
#Python
Worked  with PIL for the first time. Very cool library, did some resizing and pasting, and learned how to batch watermark images.

### Day 19: May 13, 2017 - nmap
#Python
Started a project to automate the tracking and scanning of devices connected to my network. Began by determining what my network address is and having the nmap module scan that range. Begin the first steps of parsing that data as well. 

### Day 20: May 14, 2017 - pyautogui
#Python
Worked with pyautogui to learn about automating mouse movement, clicks, screenshots, etc. Looking forward to exploring this library further to see how I can leverage it for some automation projects. 

### Day 21: May 15, 2017 - Debugging
#Python
Spent time debugging my script to parse directory structures. Have an issue using shutil.copy() to move files to the appropriate locations. Still fixing.. .

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
