# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: April 16, 2016 - Caesar Cipher
Worked on PicoCTF challenges, came across a challenge to decrypt a block of text. I thought it might have been encrypted with the caesar cipher. I worked through the inventwithpython chapter on doing the caesar cipher and learned how to grab the ascii values of characters and then shift them appropriately. In the end it turns out the block of text wasn't caesar encrypted, but I learned about ascii values so that's cool.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
